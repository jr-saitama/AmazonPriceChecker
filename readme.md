# Amazon Price Checker
---
> Create a "**urls.txt**" file in the path where you will run this Python code or exe.
---
### "**urls.txt**" should be in the format below :
* The first line should contain the [user-agent](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-user-agent)    	

* The Second line should be the _email address_ to which you wish to receive the prices

* From the third line onwards you can add as many _urls_ as you like but it should be in line by line

* To get the _urls_ just search the product in **amazon** then copy and paste the _url_ to **urls.txt** file


>You can use _task schedular_ to run the program automatically, you just have to add **urls** of products you like
